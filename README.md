# DSA Project 3: Fragrance Note Finder

The main file you want to run in order to launch the Fragrance Note Finder program is in backend/main.py. DO NOT run the other main file, it's just a print statement we used for testing.

Ensure the path for the .csv file is accurate before running main.py. To troubleshoot, try using the file's absolute path instead of the local path.

The program will give you the option to sort the data using a merge sort algorithm or a hash table. After this, put in any notes you'd like to find in a fragrance, and all of the perfumes that have that/those fragrance(s) will be shown. At the end of this, the program will also output the time (in nanoseconds) it took for the merge sort/hash table to sort the data. This allows for easy comparisons between the two.
